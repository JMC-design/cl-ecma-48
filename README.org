The ECMA-48 standard can be found here: https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-048.htm

The CL-ECMA-48 library  was created to serve my needs  when writing an
interactive program that creates a more complex terminal interface. In
order  to clean  the source  of the  aforementioned program  a tad,  I
decided to  split the  functionality into  a library.  While I  used a
small fraction of these control  functions, the library implements all
162 that the ECMA-48 standard specifies, as this was the most sensible
option. The  library also optimizes  the control functions  emitted to
the  most  compact  representation,   in  contrast  to  the  preceding
handwritten functions  which were much  less discerning and  these are
also designed to be efficient themselves and avoid any allocations and
other costly  operations. Due to  all of  this, the library  is rather
niggardly and  there's no  reason any  of it  should consume  any more
space once loaded nor should it perform poorly.
